## Visual Style Guide

### Color Palette
| Element | Color | Hex |
|---------|-------|-----|
| Background | Deep Navy Black | #0a0a0f |
| Surface/Cards | Dark Blue-Gray | #1a1a2e |
| Primary Accent | Tech Cyan | #00b4d8 |
| Secondary Accent | Neon Green | #00ff88 |
| Alert/Violation | Bright Red | #ff3b3b |
| Warning | Orange | #f97316 |
| Success/Compliant | Green | #22c55e |
| UI Text | White 70% | rgba(255,255,255,0.7) |

### HUD Design Principles
- **Minimal:** Don't clutter the frame
- **Functional:** Every element has a purpose
- **Animated:** Subtle movements keep it alive
- **Consistent:** Same bracket style, font, spacing throughout
- **Readable:** High contrast, clear typography

### Typography
- **Data readouts:** Monospace font (like SF Mono, JetBrains Mono)
- **Labels:** Clean sans-serif (like Inter, SF Pro)
- **Size:** Readable but not dominant
- **Glow:** Subtle outer glow on key text

### Camera Movement
- Smooth, professional movements throughout
- Gimbal/crane quality - no handheld shake
- Deliberate, slow movements that convey precision
- POV shots should feel stable, like mounted camera

### Lighting
- Night scene with practical light motivation
- Strong contrast between light and shadow
- Cyan accent lighting from the Falcon
- Warm street lamps for color contrast
- Wet pavement reflections for visual interest

### Sound Design Notes
- Ambient city sounds (distant traffic, urban hum)
- Subtle tech sounds for HUD elements
- Soft beep for detection
- Capture "click" sound for evidence capture
- Data transmission: subtle electronic whoosh
- No narration - visual storytelling only

## Google Veo 3.1 Prompts - Copy-Paste Ready

Generate each scene as a separate 8-second clip, then combine manually.

---

### SCENE A: Violation Detection (8 seconds)

**POV from the device detecting a speeding vehicle on a straight road.**

Copy and paste this prompt:

```
Static POV shot looking down at a straight two-lane road at night from 20 feet height, angled 30 degrees downward. Camera completely still, locked on tripod for all 8 seconds. Wet asphalt reflects streetlights. White lane markings visible. Both lanes go the SAME direction (away from camera).

Subtle cyan HUD overlay: thin grid lines on road at 20% opacity, timestamp in upper-left corner, speed limit "35 MPH" displayed in upper-right.

TIMESTAMPED VIOLATION SEQUENCE:

[00:00-00:02] A WHITE SUV drives steadily from bottom of frame toward top, in the right lane, at normal speed. A cyan targeting bracket surrounds it, tracking smoothly. Speed readout next to bracket shows "32 MPH" in white text. Bracket pulses GREEN - compliant. The SUV continues forward and begins exiting top of frame.

[00:02-00:04] A RED SEDAN enters from bottom of frame in the left lane, moving noticeably FASTER than the SUV. Targeting bracket appears around it. Speed readout shows "47 MPH" - the text turns YELLOW as a warning. The bracket color shifts from cyan to YELLOW. The sedan is speeding.

[00:04-00:06] The red sedan continues speeding forward. Speed readout now shows "52 MPH" in RED text. The targeting bracket SNAPS from yellow to bright RED, locking onto the vehicle with sharp precision. The bracket corners extend outward with technical styling. Text appears: "VIOLATION: SPEEDING" in red.

[00:06-00:08] The red violation box fully surrounds the sedan. A bright FLASH effect indicates photo capture. Data overlays appear around the box: "SPEED: 52/35 MPH", "PLATE: DETECTED", "CONFIDENCE: 96.7%". A "CAPTURED" confirmation badge appears. The sedan continues forward with the red box tracking it until it exits frame.

KEY RULES:
- Both vehicles travel SAME direction (away from camera, toward top)
- SUV is compliant (green), sedan is violating (red)
- NO opposing traffic, NO collisions
- Clear visual progression: normal → warning → violation → capture

Visual style: Dark night scene, cyan HUD elements, red for violation alerts. Clean, professional law enforcement aesthetic.

Ambient: quiet urban night, soft electronic processing hum.
SFX: soft beep when SUV passes (green), warning tone when sedan turns yellow, alert sound when violation detected, sharp camera shutter click on capture.
```

---

### SCENE B: Monitoring Department Alert (8 seconds)

**Control room screens receiving the violation alert and displaying evidence.**

Copy and paste this prompt:

```
Medium shot of a modern monitoring control room at night. The room is dimly lit with cool blue ambient lighting. We see the back of an OPERATOR sitting at a curved desk, facing THREE LARGE MONITORS mounted on the wall. The monitors display a dark dashboard interface with cyan and green accents. The operator is silhouetted, we don't see their face clearly.

The room is clean, professional, minimal. No clutter. Subtle reflections on the glossy desk surface. The aesthetic is high-tech government/municipal operations center.

TIMESTAMPED ALERT SEQUENCE:

[00:00-00:02] The monitors show a calm dashboard - a map with several camera location dots, some statistics, status indicators all showing green "NORMAL". The operator sits still, monitoring. Quiet, routine surveillance.

[00:02-00:03] Suddenly, a RED ALERT NOTIFICATION flashes onto the center monitor. A pulsing red border appears. Text: "NEW VIOLATION DETECTED". The operator leans forward slightly, attentive.

[00:03-00:05] The center monitor transitions to show the violation details. A large image appears: the red sedan from Scene A captured mid-violation, with the red targeting box around it. Next to the image, data populates line by line:
- "VIOLATION: SPEEDING"
- "SPEED: 52 MPH / LIMIT: 35 MPH"
- "LOCATION: MAIN ST, SECTOR 7"
- "TIME: 22:47:18"
- "CONFIDENCE: 96.7%"

[00:05-00:07] The left monitor shows a zoomed LICENSE PLATE image - crisp, enhanced, clearly readable (blurred/generic plate for privacy). The right monitor shows a MAP with the violation location highlighted by a pulsing red dot. All three monitors now display coordinated violation information.

[00:07-00:08] Green checkmarks animate in next to each data point on the center monitor, confirming verification. A status bar at the bottom changes from "PROCESSING" to "EVIDENCE PACKAGE COMPLETE - READY FOR REVIEW". The operator's hand moves toward the mouse, ready to take action.

VISUAL DETAILS:
- Monitors have thin bezels, mounted flush on dark wall
- Dashboard UI is dark theme (#0a0a0f background) with cyan (#00b4d8) accents
- Alert elements use red (#ff3b3b)
- Confirmation uses green (#00ff88)
- Text is clean sans-serif, data in monospace font
- Subtle screen glow illuminates the operator's silhouette

Camera is static, no movement. Shot from behind and slightly to the side of the operator, showing all three monitors clearly.

Ambient: quiet control room hum, soft computer fan noise, subtle electronic ambience.
SFX: alert chime at 00:02, soft data population sounds as text appears, green confirmation tone when checkmarks appear.
```

## Combination Instructions

**Two scenes to generate:**
1. **Scene A**: Violation Detection (POV of device catching a speeder)
2. **Scene B**: Monitoring Department (control room receiving the alert)

**Workflow:**
1. Generate Scene A in Veo 3.1 (8 seconds)
2. Generate Scene B in Veo 3.1 (8 seconds)
3. Manually combine in video editor (cut or crossfade)
4. Total duration: ~16 seconds

**Narrative:**
- **Scene A**: Device POV - we see a speeding car get detected and captured
- **Scene B**: Cut to control room - the violation alert appears on screens

**Transition:**
- Scene A ends with "CAPTURED" confirmation
- Scene B begins with calm monitoring, then alert arrives
- Simple cut works well (implies data transmission happened between scenes)

---

## Veo 3.1 Generation Tips

1. **Aspect Ratio:** Specify 1:1 (square) for product page placement
2. **Resolution:** Request 1080p for best quality
3. **Duration:** Generate 8-second clips separately, combine manually
4. **Audio:** Use `Ambient:` and `SFX:` labels on separate lines
5. **Camera Terms:** Use specific Veo-recognized terms: "POV shot", "medium shot", "static"
6. **Traffic:** Keep simple - all vehicles same direction, no intersections
7. **HUD Elements:** Describe as "targeting bracket", "data overlay", specify colors

---

## Technical Notes

- Video will display in a square (1:1) aspect ratio container
- Container has glass-morphism styling with rounded corners
- Keep critical content away from edges (corner safe area)
- Video may loop, so consider seamless loop point
- Works well at various playback sizes
