## Google Veo 3.1 Prompts - Copy-Paste Ready

Generate each scene as a separate 8-second clip, then combine in Flow for seamless transitions.

---

### SCENE A: Product Reveal & Activation (8 seconds)

**Merge of original Scene 1 + Scene 3. Use with Scene B (POV Monitoring).**

Copy and paste this prompt:

```
[00:00-00:03] Cinematic shot of a traffic enforcement device floating in pure darkness. Camera positioned 2 feet away at a 45-degree angle, slowly orbiting clockwise around the device.

The device is a compact rectangular unit, roughly the size of a shoebox, with a sleek matte black housing and smooth chamfered edges. A single circular lens sits prominently in the center, its dark glass surface catching subtle reflections. Surrounding the lens is a thin LED ring - currently OFF, dark, dormant.

The background is pure black void. Tiny particles of cyan light drift lazily through the frame from right to left, like floating data dust. Soft cyan key light from upper right illuminates the device edges. Premium Apple product video aesthetic.

[00:03-00:04] The LED ring flickers once, twice - then illuminates fully with a soft cyan glow. This is the power-on moment. The device comes alive.

[00:04-00:08] The LED ring now pulses gently like a heartbeat, glowing cyan. Volumetric light rays emerge slowly from behind the device, creating dramatic god rays spreading outward. The camera continues its slow orbit while simultaneously pushing slightly closer toward the lens. More cyan particles drift past. The device is now active, ready to watch.

Shot with 50mm lens, shallow depth of field, device razor sharp, particles softly blurred. Ultra-smooth movement, no shake. No text, no floor, no reflections - just the device floating in dramatic darkness.

Ambient: deep low-frequency electronic hum, ethereal synthesizer pad.
SFX: soft digital power-up chime at second 3 when LED activates, gentle electronic pulse matching the LED heartbeat rhythm.
```

### SCENE B: AI Monitoring POV (8 seconds)

**The POV shot showing what the device sees. Combine manually with Scene A.**

Copy and paste this prompt:

```
Static POV shot looking down at a single two-lane road at night. Camera height 20 feet, angled 30 degrees down. Camera completely still, locked, no movement for all 8 seconds.

The road is simple: two lanes side by side, both going the SAME direction (away from camera, toward the top of frame). No opposing traffic lanes. No intersection. Just two parallel lanes with white dashed line between them, solid white lines on edges. Wet asphalt reflects streetlights.

TIMESTAMPED VEHICLE SEQUENCE - ALL VEHICLES MOVE IN SAME DIRECTION (AWAY FROM CAMERA):

[00:00-00:01] Road is empty. Camera observes the wet pavement, lane markings visible. Subtle cyan grid overlay on road surface. Quiet anticipation.

[00:01-00:03] First vehicle enters from bottom of frame - a WHITE SEDAN in the right lane. It drives steadily forward (away from camera, toward top of frame) at 30 mph. A cyan targeting bracket appears around it, tracks it smoothly. The bracket pulses green once. The sedan continues toward the top of frame.

[00:03-00:05] While the white sedan is still visible ahead, a SILVER SUV enters from bottom of frame in the LEFT lane. It also drives forward at 30 mph, parallel to but behind the sedan. Targeting bracket appears, tracks it, pulses green. Both vehicles drive away from camera in their respective lanes.

[00:05-00:07] The white sedan exits top of frame. A DARK BLUE SEDAN enters from bottom in the right lane. The silver SUV continues ahead in left lane. Both drive forward. Brackets track and pulse green.

[00:07-00:08] Silver SUV exits top of frame. Blue sedan continues forward. A BLACK PICKUP enters from bottom in left lane. Both drive away from camera. Scene ends with two vehicles mid-frame, driving forward.

KEY RULES:
- ALL vehicles enter from BOTTOM, exit at TOP
- ALL vehicles drive the SAME direction (away from camera)
- NO vehicles coming toward camera
- NO opposing traffic
- NO collisions, NO disappearing
- Vehicles stay in their lanes, never cross the center line

SUBTLE HUD: Cyan grid on road at 20% opacity. Targeting brackets track each vehicle, pulse green, fade when vehicle exits.

Corner data: timestamp upper-left, vehicle count lower-right.

Ambient: quiet night, soft electronic hum.
SFX: soft green chime when each bracket pulses.
```

## Combination Instructions

**Two scenes to generate:**
1. **Scene A**: Product Reveal & Activation (device in void, LED powers on)
2. **Scene B**: AI Monitoring POV (what the device sees, traffic monitoring)

**Workflow:**
1. Generate Scene A in Veo 3.1 (8 seconds)
2. Generate Scene B in Veo 3.1 (8 seconds)
3. Manually combine in video editor (cut or crossfade transition)
4. Total duration: ~16 seconds

**Narrative:**
- **Scene A**: We see the device floating in darkness, it powers on, LED glows cyan
- **Scene B**: Cut to what the device sees - monitoring traffic from its POV

**Transition:**
- Scene A ends with camera pushing toward the glowing lens
- Scene B begins looking down at road (as if through the lens)
- Simple cut or 0.5s crossfade works well

## Veo 3.1 Generation Tips

1. **Aspect Ratio:** Specify 16:9 for hero placement
2. **Resolution:** Request 1080p for best quality
3. **Duration:** Generate 8-second clips and combine for longer sequences
4. **Audio:** Use `Ambient:` and `SFX:` labels on separate lines
5. **Camera Movement:** Use specific terms: "orbit shot", "crane shot", "POV shot", "dolly shot"
6. **Style:** Include lighting, color palette, and mood descriptors
7. **No Text:** Add "No on-screen text or subtitles" if you want clean footage

## Technical Notes

- Video will be displayed in a glass-morphism container with rounded corners
- Background behind video will have gradient effects
- Video should work well with slight opacity overlay
- Edges of video may be slightly visible through rounded corners
- Consider keeping action in the center-safe area
